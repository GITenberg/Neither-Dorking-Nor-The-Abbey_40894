<h2><span><i>NOTE</i></span></h2>

<p><i>In England recently there died a great man&mdash;the greatest of his day.
Immediately there arose much vain contention as to whether or no his
dust should be given resting place among that of his peers in
Westminster Abbey. Finally came the decision that Westminster was not to
be so honored; and the urn containing all of him that had outlived the
fire was placed in the sunny graveyard of Dorking village. Looking down
toward it from the long level summit of Box Hill&mdash;his hill,&mdash;with the
sunlight glinting from its marbles and along the silver Mole that winds
threadlike beside it, the little cemetery seems almost a living cheerful</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span><i>thing in the dark green of the surrounding landscape. Surely here, if
anywhere, was appropriate resting-place for this great lover of life and
joy.</i></p>

<p><i>The tribute to Meredith contained in the following pages, perhaps the
most fitting and beautiful of any inspired by his death, was originally
published in the London "Westminster Gazette" for May 26, 1909.</i></p>

<hr />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<h2><span><i>NEITHER DORKING<br />NOR THE ABBEY</i></span></h2>

<p>All morning there had been a little gathering of people outside the
gate. The funeral coach came, and a very small thing was placed in it
and covered with flowers. One plant of the wallflower in the garden
would have covered it. The coach took the road to Dorking, followed by a
few others, and in a moment or two all seemed silent and deserted, the
cottage, the garden, and Box Hill.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p><p>The cottage was not deserted, as they knew who now trooped into the
round in front of it, their eyes on the closed door. They were the
mighty company, his children,&mdash;Lucy and Clara and Rhoda and Diana and
Rose and old Mel and Roy Richmond and Adrian and Sir Willoughby and a
hundred others, and they stood in line against the box-wood, waiting for
him to come out. Each of his women carried a flower, and the hands of
all his men were ready for the salute.</p>

<p>In the room on the right, in an armchair which had been his home for
years&mdash;to many the throne of letters in this country&mdash;sat an old man,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>like one forgotten in an empty house. When the last sound of the
coaches had passed away he moved in his chair. He wore grey clothes and
a red tie, and his face was rarely beautiful, but the hair was white and
the limbs were feeble, and the wonderful eyes dimmed, and he was hard of
hearing. He moved in his chair, for something was happening to him, and
it was this, old age was falling from him. This is what is meant by
death to such as he, and the company waiting knew. His eyes became again
those of the eagle, and his hair was brown, and the lustiness of youth
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>was in his frame, but still he wore the red tie. He rose, and not a
moment did he remain within the house, for "golden lie the meadows,
golden run the streams," and "the fields and the waters shout to him
golden shouts." He flung open the door, as they knew he would do who
were awaiting him, and he stood there looking at them, a general
reviewing his troops. They wore the pretty clothing in which he had
loved to drape them; they were not sad like the mourners who had gone,
but happy as the forget-me-nots and pansies at their feet and the lilac
overhead, for they knew that this was his coronation day. Only one was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>airily in mourning, as knowing better than the others what fitted the
occasion, the Countess de Saldar. He recognized her sense of the fitness
of things with a bow. The men saluted, the women gave their flowers to
Dahlia to give to him, so that she should have his last word, and he
took their offerings and passed on. They did not go with him, they went
their ways to carry his glory through the world.</p>

<p>Without knowing why, for his work was done, he turned to the left,
passing his famous cherry-blossom, and climbed between apple-trees to a
little house of two rooms, whence most of that noble company had sprung.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>He went there only because he had gone so often, and this time the door
was locked; he did not know why nor care. He came swinging down the
path, singing lustily, and calling to his dogs, his dogs of the present
and the past; and they yelped with joy, for they knew they were once
again to breast the hill with him.</p>

<p>He strode up the hill whirling his staff, for which he had no longer any
other use. His hearing was again so acute that from far away on the
Dorking road he could hear the rumbling of a coach. There came to him
somehow a knowledge (it was the last he ever knew of little things) that
people had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> at variance as to whether a casket of dust should be
laid away in one hole or in another, and he flung back his head with the
old glorious action, and laughed a laugh "broad as a thousand beeves at pasture."</p>

<p>Box Hill was no longer deserted. When a great man dies&mdash;and this was one
of the greatest since Shakespeare&mdash;the immortals await him at the top of
the nearest hill. He looked up and saw his peers. They were all young,
like himself. He waved the staff in greeting. One, a mere stripling,
"slight unspeakably," detached himself from the others, crying
gloriously as he recognized his master, "Here's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> the fellow I have been
telling you about!" and ran down the hill to be the first to take his
hand. In the meantime an empty coach was rolling on to Dorking.</p>

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
